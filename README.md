# C++ Task Solutions Analysis

This repository contains solutions for three C++ programming tasks, analyzed using different language models. Each task has multiple implementations and a final optimized solution with documentation.

```

## Tasks

1. **Password Generator**
   - Three complexity levels
   - Random generation with mixed character types
   - User input for complexity selection

2. **Calculator Tree**
   - Infix expression parsing
   - Tree construction and evaluation
   - Tree transformation (x*A → A*x)
   - File I/O operations

3. **Graph Degree Calculator**
   - Adjacency matrix processing
   - Vertex degree calculation
   - Loop handling (counted twice)
   - Sorted output

## Documentation

Each final solution includes XML documentation with:
- Function descriptions
- Parameter details
- Return value information
- Usage examples
- Implementation notes
